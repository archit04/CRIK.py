# CRIK.py
Ever remember😀 playing Hand cricket ✋🏏 with your batchmates in your school time.🏫

what a wonderful time it was.

But unfortunately the pandemic period😷 has left us wide apart from our friends.

So, to refresh your mood😀 and to jump into the ocean🌊 of your childhood memeories, CRIK.py is there to help you 

Rules for the game:⭐

It's basically an online cricket game🏏💻 where you can score any number of runs from 1 to 6

and whenever you do this, the computer throws a random number

If the number equals the runs you scored then you are declared out.👆

And if not then, the game continues until you are declared out.😀

HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY THE GAME🔥🔥
